## 2024-05-18 - Case-insensitive filtering in Dart tight loops
**Learning:** Using `String.toLowerCase()` inside a tight `where` loop in Dart allocates a new String for every item evaluated. In lists of strings like search results or tag lists, this creates massive GC pressure.
**Action:** Use a precompiled `RegExp` with `caseSensitive: false` before the loop, and use `searchRegex.hasMatch(item)` inside the loop instead.

## 2026-08-16 - REJECTED, do not resubmit: RegExp-precompile on `WpSearchableListPage._filtered`
**Rejected 11 times** (#39, #40, #44, #48, #50, #53, #55, #58, #61, #63, #64) — this is the single most
resubmitted PR in this repo's history. The 2024-05-18 entry above is true in general but does **not**
apply to this specific call site, and applying it there anyway is exactly what caused the loop:
`WpSearchableListPage._filtered` runs over Snippets/Replacements lists that are typically a few dozen
items — the maintainer has stated repeatedly (#58, #61) that the claimed win is unbenchmarked and the
regex still gets recompiled once per keystroke either way, so there's no measured improvement to point
to. **Do not propose this again without an actual before/after benchmark number in the PR body** (e.g.
`dart run tool/bench_search_filter.dart` output, or equivalent instrumented timing) — a generic
"reduces GC pressure" claim is not sufficient and will be closed on sight.
**Meta-lesson:** before opening a perf PR that touches search/filter loops, run
`gh pr list --state closed --search "<the widget/file name>"` and read the closing comments — merged
`git log` on `dev` only shows *accepted* changes; it will never show you the 10 times this exact idea
was already rejected, because rejected PRs never touch `dev`.

## 2024-05-18 - RegExp performance pattern vs WpSearchableListPage restrictions
**Learning:** For case-insensitive string filtering in tight loops (like `Iterable.where`), using a precompiled `RegExp` with `caseSensitive: false` instead of `String.toLowerCase()` avoids massive memory allocation overhead and GC spikes. However, this optimization was explicitly rejected by maintainers for `WpSearchableListPage._filtered` (Snippets/Replacements). It IS valid for standalone implementations like `VocabularyImportReviewPage._applyFilter` where candidate lists can be tens of thousands of items long.
**Action:** Apply the RegExp filtering pattern for large list case-insensitive filtering outside of `WpSearchableListPage`, but ensure dynamic inputs are sanitized using `RegExp.escape()`.
