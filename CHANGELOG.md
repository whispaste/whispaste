# Changelog

## 1.2.4

### Improvements

- Release now includes MSIX package for Windows, enabling direct Microsoft Store deployment and enterprise sideloading.

## 1.2.3

### Bug Fixes

- **History detail editor**: Enter, Backspace, and Delete keys are no longer intercepted by list-level keyboard shortcuts when a text field has focus. All standard editing operations (line breaks, character deletion, cursor movement) now work correctly in the transcript editor, notes field, and tag input.

## 1.2.2

### macOS

- macOS app ships as a native ARM64 DMG with every release — direct download and Gatekeeper instructions included.
- Floating button context menu expanded: open WhisPaste, start recording, view history, open settings, or quit — all accessible via right-click on the floating button.
- macOS menu bar icon now displays correctly and resolves paths reliably across all bundle layouts.

## 1.2.1

Re-release of 1.2.0 with consistent version metadata and release pipeline
stabilization. No user-visible app changes.

## 1.2.0

Complete rewrite: WhisPaste is now a native **Flutter** application replacing the previous Go+WebView2 architecture.

### What's New

- **Native Flutter UI** — truly cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) with a single Dart codebase
- **SQLite via Drift** — all data stored locally in a type-safe database; no shared config files
- **Riverpod state management** — reactive, testable, maintainable architecture
- **Unified design system** — WpToast notifications, WpDialog modals, consistent theme tokens
- **Recording pill overlay** — slim, elegant status bar during dictation with progress ring
- **Floating button** — always-on-top recording trigger with context menu and multi-monitor support
- **Premium UI** — warm gradients, frosted glass effects, micro-animations, WCAG AA contrast
- **469+ automated tests** — widget, unit, and integration tests with >90% feature coverage

### Architecture

- All Go backend code removed — zero Go dependencies
- CI/CD updated for Flutter-only builds (Windows debug + release)
- Security scanning migrated from golangci-lint/gosec to flutter analyze + gitleaks
- Version centralized in `pubspec.yaml` with `app_info.dart` constant

### Breaking Changes

- Settings are stored in SQLite, not the legacy Go `config.json`
- No Go FFI bridge — all inference via whisper-server subprocess

---

## 1.1.3.0

A polished UI update that makes WhisPaste feel faster, clearer, and more intuitive to use.

### Highlights

- Redesigned dashboard, Smart Mode, and Voice Snippets screens with cleaner cards and better spacing.
- Smart Mode and Voice Snippets now have separate AI provider settings — choose local or cloud independently.
- Silence removal is now a single, unified setting combining voice detection and trim in one step.
- Page transitions are now smooth and animated for a more premium feel.
- Auto-generated tags now use Title Case and block system tags from leaking into your entries.

### UI and copy improvements

- Settings reorganized into clearer sections with more descriptive labels.
- Replaced jargon like "Transcription" and "Diktat" with everyday language throughout.
- All German translations reviewed and aligned with the current English copy.
- Contextual tips explain features where you need them, not just in onboarding.

### Reliability

- Fixed a race condition when switching pages quickly during transitions.
- Version metadata in Windows resources now stays in sync with the release version.
- Silence detection margins tuned to industry best practices (250 ms pre-speech, 350 ms post-speech).

## 1.1.2.0

This release focuses on safer crash reporting, clearer setup flows, and more consistent communication across the app and website.

### Highlights

- Crash reporting now uses a Supabase relay instead of shipping a direct Discord webhook in the app.
- Release builds now require the public crash-relay URL, so packaged builds keep crash delivery working reliably.
- The onboarding try-dictation flow no longer marks onboarding complete too early while transcription is still finishing.

### Privacy and security

- Public builds ship only the relay URL. Private secrets stay server-side in Supabase.
- Crash-message sanitization is stricter for API keys, bearer tokens, and similar secrets.
- Setup docs now clearly explain which Supabase values are public and which must never be committed.

### Product and copy updates

- Website copy now reflects the real product setup more accurately: local transcription or the cloud provider you choose.
- Privacy messaging now explains optional crash reporting more transparently.
- Download and release messaging no longer implies an OpenAI-only setup.

### Reliability

- Release workflow validation now fails early if the crash-relay configuration is missing or malformed.
- Build metadata stays aligned with the release version more consistently.
